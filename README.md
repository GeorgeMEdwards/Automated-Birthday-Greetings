# Automated-Birthday-Greetings
This project automates the process of sending an email to a friend, colleague or loved one to wish them a Happy Birthday.  The project demonstrates the use of SMTP protocol using Python's smtplib module, the datetime module and the Pandas Library. 
To run and test the code you need to update 4 places:
#### 1. Change MY_EMAIL/MY_PASSWORD to your own details.
#### 2. Go to your email provider and make it allow less secure apps.
#### 3. Update the SMTP ADDRESS to match your email provider.
#### 4. Update birthdays.csv to contain today's month and day.
